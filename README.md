    Reverse Engineering work for the user.

# Stages

    At the moment it does a simple auto int main code..
    It is really bare bone so a lot of room to improve.
    Like it never put the " " inbetween the printf string.
    
    
# Plans

    I plan on giving the AI I keyword to do the code for me... Advanced mode
    Then you can save this code into a source file and add it to your project in
    visual studio after you have already set up your project enviroment..
    
    
# Learning Templates

    The AI Will learn from templates as a way to adapt and do based on keyword tie in.
    Later on maybe even make a algorithm for using the internet to grab code examples
    to use based on the keyword inputed by the user.
    
    
# Self Learning AI

    This is not that I do not have the massive computing power to allow such a feature 
    as this. You the user still needs to give a keyword input to allow the ai to do a task
    for you.
    
    
# Why Use this

    It will take out most of the time making a game engine for your Reverse engineering work.
    Or if you are making a simple 3d game etc.. This will cut your time in half or more.
    
    
# Releases

    None at the moment in basic coding stages..
