# Stages

    At the moment it does a simple auto int main code..
    
    
# Plans

    I plan on giving the AI I keyword to do the code for me... Advanced mode
    Then you can save this code into a source file and add it to your project in
    visual studio after you have already set up your project enviroment..
    
    
# Why Use this

    It will take out most of the time making a game engine for your Reverse engineering work.
    Or if you are making a simple 3d game etc.. This will cut your time in half or more.
    
    
# Releases

    None at the moment in basic coding stages..
